Based On:

Express: Framework for Nodejs,

Sentiment(https://github.com/thisandagain/sentiment): AFINN-based sentiment analysis for Node.js sentiment by Andrew Sliwinsky. He describes it as "a Node.js module that uses the AFINN-111 wordlist to perform sentiment analysis on arbitrary blocks of input text." This is a relatively simple implementation of sentiment analysis, as you'll see. It simply scores the words in your text using a dictionary of English words that have been rated for positive or negative sentiment.
